/**
 * A concrete implementation of {@link uk.ac.ebi.gxa.R.AtlasRFactory} that generates RServices that run on the local
 * machine.  As local R installations are not thread-safe, only one computation can be calculated at a time.  Therefore,
 * createRServices() will release at most one RService for use at any one time, and repeat requests will block until the
 * previously acquired RService has been released.
 * <br/>
 * Please refer to <a href="http://www.rforge.net/JRI/">this page</a> on how to configure environment for running local
 * R services.

 *    <li>Q:  I get the following error, what's wrong? <br/>
 *        <code>java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError</code>: no jri in <code>java.library.path</code>
 *    </li>
 *    <li>A:  Usually it means that you didn't setup the necessary environment variables properly or the JRI library is not
 *        where it is expected to be. The recommended way to start JRI programs is to use the run script which is
 *        generated along with the library. It sets everything up and is tested to work. If you want to write your
 *        own script or launcher, you must observe at least the following points:
 *        <ul>
 *           <li>R_HOME must be set correctly</li>
 *           <li>(Windows): The directory containing R.dll must be in your PATH</li>
 *           <li>(Mac): Well, it's a Mac, so it just works ;) </li>
 *           <li>(unix): R must be compiled using --enable-R-shlib and the directory containing libR.so must be in
 *               LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Also libjvm.so and other dependent Java libraries must be on LD_LIBRARY_PATH.</li>
 *           <li>JRI library must be in the current directory or any directory listed in <code>java.library.path</code>.
 *               Alternatively you can specify its path with <code>-Djava.library.path=</code> when starting the JVM.
 *               When you use the latter, make sure you check <code>java.library.path</code> property first such that
 *               you won't break your Java.</li>
 *        </ul>
 *     </li>
