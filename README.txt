* What is ArrayExpress Gene Expression Atlas

The ArrayExpress Gene Expression Atlas is a semantically enriched database of meta-analysis based summary statistics
over a curated subset of ArrayExpress Archive, servicing queries for condition-specific gene expression patterns as well
as broader exploratory searches for biologically interesting genes/samples.

To cite the Atlas in your research or to learn more about it, please refer to Kapushesky M et al. (2010), "Gene
Expression Atlas at the European Bioinformatics Institute", Nucleic Acids Research Database Issue 2010,
http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp936?ijkey=zMCQ9oPVLrhe7zk&keytype=ref.

The EBI Gene Expression Atlas is running at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa.
