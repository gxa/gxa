= Gene Expression Atlas DAS Source =

The Gene Expression Atlas provides gene-level expression analytics annotation
data as a Distributed Annotation System (DAS) source that can be accessed with
specialized DAS clients or viewed through DAS-enabled genome browsers, like
[[http://www.ensembl.org|Ensembl]]. 

== Distributed Annotation System ==

The <b>Distributed Annotation System</b> (DAS) defines a communication protocol
used to exchange
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_project#Genome_annotation|annotations]] on
genomic or protein sequences.  It is motivated by the idea that such
annotations should not be provided by single centralized databases, but should
instead be spread over multiple sites. Data distribution, performed by DAS
servers, is separated from visualization, which is done by DAS clients.

DAS is a client-server system in which a single client integrates information from 
multiple servers. It allows a single machine to gather up sequence annotation 
information from multiple distant web sites, collate the information, and display it
to the user in a single view. Little coordination is needed among the various 
information providers.

More information about DAS can be found at
[[http://www.biodas.org/wiki/Everything_DAS|BioDas.org: Everything DAS]].

== Enabling the Atlas DAS Source in the Ensembl Genome Browser ==

It is easy to enable the display of Gene Expression Atlas gene expression
analytics annotations in the Ensembl Genome Browser, by adding/enabling the
Atlas DAS source in the http://www.ensembl.org portal:

1. Go to http://www.ensembl.org and navigate to a gene page by searching for a
gene or via a direct link, for example, for human gene BRCA2:
http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000139618  

2. Enter the "Configure this page" wizard

3. Go to "Custom Data" tab, select "Attach DAS" and specify the Atlas DAS URL
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/das), and with all other settings kept default
proceed to the next step

Note: the Gene Expression Atlas DAS source is also registered in the
[[http://www.dasregistry.org|DAS Registry]]. You can select the Gene Expression
Atlas from the DAS Registry, bypassing the need to enter the Atlas URL
manually.

4. Select the Gene Expression Atlas DAS source (it will be the only one
displayed) and proceed to the next step

5. A screen confirming the successfully attached DAS source will be displayed,
with only one more step remaining to view the Atlas data in Ensembl. You need
to navigate to the "Configure page" tab from the confirmation screen.

6. On the "Configure page" screen you need to check the newly added DAS source
("Gene Expression Atlas") and confirm your choice by pressing the "SAVE and
close" button

7. The Atlas DAS source will appear under the "External Data" menu item, and
navigating there will display Atlas gene expression analytics data for the
currently chosen gene.

== Atlas DAS Source Details ==

This section explains the information you see in the Atlas DAS source. For every gene three types of expression annotations are displayed:

1. Gene expression summary

A one sentence summary of tissues, diseases, cell lines and cell types where
the gene showed the strongest differential expression in multiple studies, as
well as the total numbers of experiments and other conditions where the gene
was found to be active.

2. Sites or conditions where the gene is differentially expressed.

The listing of all biological sites or conditions under which the gene was
active together, and for each condition, the list of experiments where this
condition was observed together with a list of other comparison conditions
within that experiment.

3. Experiments where the gene was studied and showed differential expression. 

The listing of all experiments where the gene was studied. For each experiment,
a brief summary of the gene's activity as well as the overall experimental
design (experimental variables and their values) is provided.
