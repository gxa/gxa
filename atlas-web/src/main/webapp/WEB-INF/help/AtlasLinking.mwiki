= Linking to the Gene Expression Atlas =

== Gene links ==
You can link directly to information about the expression of genes in the Atlas using gene identifiers and [http://www.geneontology.org/ Gene Ontology] (GO) terms in a URL link. Gene identifiers that can be used include [http://www.ensembl.org Ensembl], [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/ EMBL]/[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ GenBank], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene/ UniGene], [http://www.uniprot.org/ UniProt]
and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/ RefSeq] identifiers.

The format of a URL link to the Atlas is as follows:

<pre>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/gene/IDENTIFIER</pre>

If the identifier matches one single gene (e.g. [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/gene/ENSMUSG00000000701 ENSMUSG00000000701]) then the gene view page for the gene will be returned. This provides a one-page summary of Atlas information about a given gene. If the identifier matches more than one gene (e.g. [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/gene/GO:0032094 GO:0032094]) then a heat map view of the results for all the genes that link to the identifier will be shown. See the [[AtlasHelp|help on searching Atlas]] for more information.


== Experiment links ==
You can also link directly to an Atlas experiment knowing the experiment accession (e.g. [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiment/E-MEXP-1014 E-MEXP-1014]).
The format of a URL link to the Atlas Experiment View is as follows:

<pre>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiment/ACCESSION</pre>

== Programmatic Access==
For information about creating complex queries of the Atlas programmatically see the [[AtlasApis|Atlas programmatic access help pages]].
